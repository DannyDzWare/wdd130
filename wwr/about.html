            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                White Water Rafting was founded five years ago by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a deep passion for the thrill of navigating rushing rivers. 
                What started as a small operation with a handful of rafts and a big dream has grown into a trusted leader in adventure tourism. 
                Our mission has always been to bring people closer to nature while providing safe, thrilling, and unforgettable experiences. 
                Over the years, we’ve had the privilege of guiding countless adventurers through some of the most stunning waterways, creating cherished memories along the way. 
                Today, White Water Rafting continues to embody our commitment to adventure, safety, and environmental stewardship, 
                inviting explorers of all levels to discover the beauty and excitement of the great outdoors with us.
