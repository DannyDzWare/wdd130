                My name is Daniel, I am 31 years young and I love connecting hardware and software.
                When I was a teenager I received a model train. I quickly realized that a lot of things 
                there are really expensive. So I started to work with microcontrollers. At some point Arduinos
                came on the market and I could use them to to control the lights, signals and even trains.
                At some point I got motivated to start learning writing programs for windows and controlling
                them from there.                
                Now I am about to learn moving the stuff to the web.

            <p>Germany is a country in the middle of Europe, surrounded by nine neighbors like France, Austria, and Poland. 
                It is known for its beautiful landscapes, including tall mountains in the south, thick forests, and busy cities like Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg. 
                Germany has a long history of famous thinkers, artists, and inventors. It’s also famous for making excellent cars and celebrating traditions like Oktoberfest 
                and Christmas markets. Germany combines old traditions with modern ideas, making it an exciting and important place in Europe.</p>
