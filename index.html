                    My name is Daniel, I am 31 years young and I love connecting hardware and software.
                    When I was a teenager I received a model train. I quickly realized that a lot of things 
                    there are really expensive. So I started to work with microcontrollers. At some point Arduinos
                    came on the market and I could use them to to control the lights, signals and even trains.
                    At some point I got motivated to start learning writing programs for windows and controlling
                    them from there.                
                    Now I am about to learn moving the stuff to the web.
